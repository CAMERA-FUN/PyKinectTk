His existing code has been adapted and is included as a sub-package as part of this module.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- [PyGame](http://pygame.org/hifi.html) (For Playback)*\r\n- [OpenCV2](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_setup_in_windows/py_setup_in_windows.html#install-opencv-python-in-windows) (For colour stream capture)\r\n- [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) (For automated click-stepping - see below)\r\n- [comtypes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/comtypes)\r\n\r\n\\* Non-official 64-bit installtion of PyGame can be found [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame)\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIn the Examples folder there are two files; `ex-capture.py` and `ex-playback.py`. These can be used to collect data from a running Kinect Service, and also playback this data to the user.\r\n\r\n### Example 1: Data Capture\r\n\r\nWatch this space...\r\n\r\n### Example 2: Data Playback\r\n\r\nAnd this one too...\r\n",
