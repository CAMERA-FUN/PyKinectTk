--------------------------------------------------------------
A Python application for extracting data from Kinect Studio V2
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Note:**
This Python package uses a lot of code from PyKinect2, which can be found here: https://github.com/vladkol, and I would like to thank vladkol for his incredible work. His existing code has been adapted and is included as a sub-package as part of this module.

Requirements
------------

* `PyGame <http://pygame.org/hifi.html>`_ (For Playback)*
* `OpenCV2 <https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_setup_in_windows/py_setup_in_windows.html#install-opencv-python-in-windows>`_ (For colour stream capture)
* `PyAutoGUI <https://pyautogui.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ (For automated click-stepping - see below)

\* Non-official 64-bit installtion of PyGame can be found `here <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame>`_

Examples
--------

In the Examples folder there are two files; `ex-capture.py` and `ex-playback.py`. These can be used to collect data from a running Kinect Service, and also playback this data to the user.
