# PyKinectXEF
Python application for extracting data from Kinect Studio V2

NOTE: 99% of this is inherited from https://github.com/vladkol and his incredible work on the PyKinect2 HOWEVER for this application to work, you must use the PyKinect2 files included HERE as they have been edited and will not work without copying them into your Python/Lib folder.
