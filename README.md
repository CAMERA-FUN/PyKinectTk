# PyKinectXEF
Python application for extracting data from Kinect Studio V2

NOTE: 99% of this is inherited from https://github.com/vladkol and his incredible work on the PyKinect2 HOWEVER for this application to work, you must use the PyKinect2 files included HERE as they have been edited and will not work without them. You can either use the PyKinect2 package exclusively with PyKinectXEF application, or move the pykinect2 folder into your Python/Lib/site-packages folder (or elsewhere in your PYTHONPATH) to use with your own applications.

# First Time Use
--------------

When using PyKinectXEF for the first time, you will notice that it populate the folder containing the PyKinectXEF package as opposed to the package directory itself. This is so that I can upload this to GitHub without fear of uploading any personal data. I will definitely look at a folder lookup option and storing that data but for now you will have to make do!
